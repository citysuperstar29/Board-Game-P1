# Board-Game-P1

In this version, there is no enemy turn,
there is no restriction to the players movement,
there is no end of the game,
also the randomness is cool, but it isnt very practical.

Also. The Heroes and Enemies are all the exact same, 
excluding the fact that the game recognises that they are a part of factions.
